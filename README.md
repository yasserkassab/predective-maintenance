# predective-maintenance

This repository contains a predictive maintenance analysis project that uses machine learning to classify machine failures based on various operational parameters. The project employs XGBoost for both binary and multiclass classification tasks, utilizing 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate model performance. The dataset is preprocessed through encoding categorical variables and selecting relevant features based on mutual information scores. The performance metrics, including average F1 scores, classification reports, and confusion matrices, are visualized to assess the effectiveness of the models.
